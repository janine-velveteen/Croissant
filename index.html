    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
        Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>

<p>Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.</p>
